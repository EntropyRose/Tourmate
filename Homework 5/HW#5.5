HW#5.5: Beachhead Market Analysis 

The primary market identified for the Tourmate consists of rich holidaymakers and international customers who 
take long vacations and need in-depth information about their places of visit. Information is very important 
for these customers because they need help from locals and professionals in order to make the best out of their 
travels. The study indicates that targeting people who tend to travel internationally or to strange and far-off 
places for the first time would be a good starting point, as these people would very likely appreciate and pay 
for expensive features like personalized recommendations and off-line access. Working with luxury travel agencies 
and hotels will enable Tourmate to easily access and capture this primary market.
